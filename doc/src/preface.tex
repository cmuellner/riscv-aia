\chapter{Preface}

This document describes an Advanced Interrupt Architecture
being proposed for {\RISCV} systems.

No part of this document has yet been ratified
by the {\RISCV} International Association.
The table below shows the current status of each chapter,
and also indicates which chapters specify extensions to the
{\RISCV} ISA (instruction set architecture) and which are non-ISA.

An implementation adhering to the current document might not conform
to an eventual ratified Advanced Interrupt Architecture for {\RISCV}.
The chapters marked in the table as \emph{Frozen} are not expected
to change significantly before being put up for ratification.
The chapters marked \emph{Draft} are very much
at risk of changing before ratification.

Concerning the two chapters that remain in draft state:
\begin{itemize}

\item
The authors are not aware that any implementation of
a Duo-PLIC yet exists, even one just for simulation.
So long as that remains true, the Duo-PLIC specification of
Chapter~\ref{ch:DuoPLIC} will not advance beyond draft status.

\item
A separate standard is being developed for IOMMUs in {\RISCV} systems.
Chapter~\ref{ch:IOMMU} about an IOMMU's support for MSIs
(message-signaled interrupts) is expected to be finalized
only in conjunction with the full {\RISCV} IOMMU specification.

\item
Any advancement of these chapters will be constrained such that it does
not change the ratified parts of this document (e.g. by adding new CSRs).
\end{itemize}
